# Basic Game Engine: Wolf-3d
Inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, which has been recognized as the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games, the goal of this project is to build a basic game engine using ray casting technique.

## Objectives
The fun part of this project is the bonuses. But before we can start hunting Nazis, we need to completely match the following requirments. <br>
- Create a 3D graphically “realistic” representation that we could have from inside a maze in a subjective view.
- Be able to choose the size and the shape of mazes, it has to be a file outside of the source code.
- The management of the window must remain smooth: passing over of another window, minimization, etc.
- Pressing ESC and click the red cross on the window must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
- The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like in the original game.
- Display different wall textures that vary depending on which compass point the wall is facing.

## How to start
First build the project with makefile
```
make
```
After "wolf3d" created, execute it with a map. Some maps can be found under maps/ folder, and of course anyone is welcome to create their own map ;)
```
// For instance, run teature room
./wolf3d maps/teasure_room.txt
```
W & S to move forward and backward, A & D to rotate.<br>
Looks like you had found Nazi's teasures!<br>
